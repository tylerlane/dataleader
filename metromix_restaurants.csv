BUT WAIT!! This is a special night for everyone. First, Matt Stell will have graduated earlier that day, so this show is a graduation party for him and all other newly pedigreed persons in attendance. Secondly, this show will mark MS&amp;C's formal record release in Springfield. Now you may ask yourself, ""How can one do a record release when the record as been around and for sale for a while?"" Well the answer is that Stell &amp; the Crashers are being courted by some people in the music biz, and before big things can happen, the record needs to have a formal release date. So come support the fellas and be a part of big things.  The Josh Davis Band, a Snorty Horse favorite from Iowa, will open the show. Invite your friends, family, neighbors, and ex'es and kick off the last summer of the decade in style!  See all of you there."
